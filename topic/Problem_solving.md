## Some problem to practice
* **Arrays/Strings:** 
  * Sort an array of 0s, 1s and 2s
  * Determine if a string is a palindrome
  * Largest histogram

  * Merge two sorted arrays
  * Smallest no. After itself
      * http://buttercola.blogspot.com/2016/01/leetcode-count-of-smaller-numbers-after.html 
  * Reverse an array in place
  * Find substring
  * All sorting algorithms
  * Binary search in a sorted rotated array
  * Max profit stock problem

* **Linked List:**
  * Reverse a singly linked list
  * Delete/Insert a node in a linked list
  * Detect if there is a cycle in the list and return its starting point
  * Merge two sorted lists
  * Split a list into two lists one has even indexes other has odd indexes

* **Trees:**
  * Check if tree is balanced
  * All traversals, recursive and iterative implementations
  * BFS/DFS
  * Construct a BST from a sorted array
  * Check if two trees are mirror image of each other
  * Find max path sum in the tree, negative nodes possible
  * Lowest common ancestor of 2 nodes in a tree

* **Backtracking:**
  * Find all permutations or combinations
  * Find all possible subsets
  * N queens problem
  * Convert numbers into words according to letters on an old phone keypad

* **Hashtables**
  * Questions where you need to keep track of multiple occurences of same object
  * Questions where you want to have a 2 tuple as a key

* **Dynamic programming:**
  * Given you can climb 1,2, or 3 stairs in one step, how many ways of reaching the top
  * How many ways to go from top left of a grid to bottom right of the grid with some obstacles in between
  
  **Note:** Implement both bottom up and top down solutions for both of the above
  
* **Miscellaneous**
  * Design a data structure which provides following APIs:-
    * insert element in O(1)
    * delete an element in O(1)
    * find a random element in O(1)
